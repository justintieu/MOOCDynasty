You will be encouraged to carry out your own experiments using materials that are often found in the home. If not they can be obtained from most supermarkets, pharmacies or hardware stores. Along the way you will use fruit tea to identify acids and alkalis, investigate chemicals that speed up reactions and experiment with electron transfer reactions. This should give you a feel for the world of molecules and an idea of some reactions. It should also introduce some methods to separate chemicals, to find out what chemicals are present in a mixture and ways to change chemicals from one form to another. It is aimed at a wide range of ages. Children under 13 years of age are not able to sign up for the course, but an adult is welcome to sign up on their behalf and adult supervision is advised for young children doing the experiments.

New ideas can be plentiful, but selecting the best ideas and implementing them can be challenging. Managing the innovation process is neither a scientific process nor a black art. In addition to detailed research and planning, its success is influenced by human factors and, of course, luck! In order to make sense of this complex topic, we have created a model for the innovation process and its management. The course will describe the PROCESS; the way the innovation pathway works from creation of new ideas to their selection and implementation. We will study four main areas that influence this process: We will study the PERSON/PEOPLE that are involved in the process. This will include the entrepreneur, the inventor and the innovator, for example. By studying the POSSIBILITY of coming up with new ideas and making them happen, we will take a detailed look at creativity and opportunity spotting. We will focus on the PROTECTION of ideas through intellectual property and how this can help/hinder the innovation process.

With the decline of local professional media and the low cost of publishing online there are more community and hyper-local sites being launched to take the place of local newspapers and radio. For both those seeking to launch and support a site and for those wishing to study this new media sector there are practical skills and theory to be mastered. It is an area which combines elements of traditional journalism with the new skills of digital journalism and community focus. Cardiff University launched the UK’s first academic Centre for Community Journalism last year to help nurture and study this growing sector. Over five weeks, this course builds on that expertise and experience to offer insight and practical skills for all those interested in community and hyper local journalism. The course combines practical skills in setting up a community website, identifying and building an audience, creating content, establishing a workflow to sustain a site, managing an online community, media law and ethics, with a broader understanding of this new sector, how it has developed and the experience of those operating community sites.

It draws upon the experience of staff from the Mathematics Education Centre at Loughborough University - a centre that has specialised for many years in mathematics teaching and mathematics support for science and engineering students who find the transition to university mathematics particularly challenging. Through an accessible introduction to graphical and algebraic techniques students will start to think mathematically and develop an informal understanding of vital properties of points, lines and curves before formalizing mathematically some of these essential notions. We adopt a user-friendly approach and describe mathematical processes in everyday language. New ideas are developed by example and discovery rather than by formal proof. Further development will introduce the equation of a line and the significance of its slope and vertical intercept. The course will close by reinforcing the importance of mathematics to science and engineering. It will pave the way into the study of calculus by explaining that engineers and scientists need to build upon the ideas introduced in order to describe, analyze and predict the behavior of physical, biological and technological systems.

Ethno-political conflicts around the world tend to differ in detail but share common structural and political issues. Fundamental to the conflicts is the ability for groups of people to have access to representation in public space. In Northern Ireland, throughout the peace process, contestation over flags, parades and memorials has been frequent. As South Africa developed a new democracy the management of demonstrations by the police became a key issue. Eastern European countries in the post-soviet era have slowly come to terms with the rights of diverse political groups to express their political opinions in public spaces. And post-9/11, western democracies have struggled to define public space for their large Muslim communities. How is freedom of expression managed in highly divided societies, particularly when they have a history of political violence This course will start by looking at the nature of social groups and the importance of identity and public spaces in politics around the world (for example the Arab Spring, the Occupy Movement, Civil Rights Movements). It will then examine why understanding public space is important through looking at symbols, parades and memorials. The course will examine well documented examples, focusing on the learning that has arisen from the Northern Ireland peace process. It will explore the role of human rights and public policy.

We will start with reflecting on the nature of drugs and take a historical perspective on some everyday drugs which have been taken by humans for centuries. What this will show us is that many drugs in common use were found somewhat accidentally and often, at least originally, without any understanding of the science behind how they worked. Over time this apparently random process has been refined and improved and so we will go on to consider recent advances in identifying potential drugs. However, finding a molecule that has the potential to act as a drug is not the end of the process. The critical questions then are how to get it into the body, how much needs to be taken and will it be safe enough as well as effective.

Aimed at people who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility in any type of organisation, this course will introduce you to reflective practice in people management. “The conventional definition of management is getting work done through people, but real management is developing people through work.” Agha Hasan Abedi Think back to your last few days in the workplace. Were you and your team energised, focused and all delivering real benefit to the organisation As managers our task is to deploy resources so that we can achieve results. In our rapidly changing world this is never easy, especially when our delivery is based on the efforts of other people. People can be hugely creative and enthusiastic, or negative and distracted. People are much more than a source of labour; we are complex and are all different from each other. So how do we energise a disparate group of people and get them pulling together – and keep them pulling together The course will arm you to deal more effectively with the challenges you regularly face. It will provide you with different ways of looking at difficult situations and will give you a broader range of techniques to use when dealing with them. We will cover aspects of management theory and psychology, but our premise is that management is as much an art as it is a science. We cannot make you a great artist in nine weeks but we can set you on the path. “Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet” Henry Mintzberg Who is this course for The course is primarily designed for people who are already working and who have, or are about to have, managerial responsibility. However, the course does not presume any prior knowledge of management theory. The nature of the organisation in which you work – or hope to work – is immaterial. The depth of thinking and analysis will broadly be at a post-graduate level thus making this an ideal taster course should you be thinking of pursuing a masters degree in business or management in the future. However, you don’t need to have a degree to participate. What might I learn and how might this benefit me How to manage people and get them engaged. How to get the best out of people. What good management practice is, and how it could be developed sustainably through a process of continuing reflection. Tools and techniques to help you deal more effectively with challenges you may regularly face. What will the learning experience be like and what will be expected of me The course will take place online and will consist of a variety of videos, articles, discussions, quizzes and activities based on your experience. You must be willing to think about the ideas we will discuss in the context of your experiences of managing (and being managed) and to reflect on more effective approaches. Indeed, sharing your experiences and reflections with others on the course will help you to get the most out of it.

Achieving cooperation on such issues is the defining concern of international politics in the 21st century and this course will introduce you to the range of political strategies that have been employed to meet these challenges. From institutions that bring together partners in meaningful and lasting agreements to more fragile and limited attempts to open dialogue between adversaries, Cooperation in the contemporary world offers you an insight into the diversity of the forms of cooperation that make up international politics today. We will also explore a number of the major theoretical approaches that can help us make sense of the opportunities for and limitations of cooperation in an increasingly globalised and interdependent world. Cooperation in the contemporary world offers you the opportunity to learn according to your interests and available time. We’ve split each week into activities which can be completed together or individually.

Our central concern is ‘How we will feed an extra two billion people by the middle of this century’ Focussing both on UK agriculture and on food supply chains in other parts of the world, we will examine how food has shaped our environmental and social landscapes. We will see that, while everyone would agree that food security is ‘a good thing’, ideas about what it means in practice and how it should be achieved vary tremendously. Proposed developments to address global food insecurity range from technological inventions in the efficacy of large-scale agriculture through social and cultural innovations in local food production and consumption. You’ll be exploring a number of topics that address many issues including: Is food security really just about food Should we have concerns about health, social justice, environmental degradation and cultural diversity What is the role of technology and innovation in promoting food security And much more. In the final week we explore the big picture by considering food systems and food chains as a whole. Using examples from some of the case studies that we’ve explored, we consider the relationships between production and consumption and question whether particular kinds of agriculture are linked to particular diets and patterns of consumption. We will explore the role of the retailer and the consumer in more detail as we ask what it means to enjoy a safe, healthy, sustainable diet. We also consider the issue of food poverty and how this fits within the food security debate.

On this course you will chart a journey from the Imperial harbour to its connections across the Mediterranean, learning about what the archaeological discoveries uncovered by the Portus Project tell us about the history, landscape, buildings, and the people of this unique place. Although the site lies in ruins, it has some of the best-preserved Roman port buildings in the Mediterranean, and in this course you will learn to interpret these and the finds discovered within them, using primary research data and the virtual tools of the archaeologist.

People from many different backgrounds now want to understand the basics of programming, because it’s both fun and an increasingly valuable skill. One of the most exciting ways to learn programming is through authoring your own creative programs. Known as “creative coding”, this growing field uses computer software as a medium to develop original creative expression. So if you’re an artist, designer, architect or musician who’s interested in how you can expand your creative skills, or even a computer programmer looking to work in creative applications, you will find this course extremely useful. Throughout the course we’ll help you develop practical programming concepts and skills by exploring creative ideas and challenges. We’ll be looking at the history and philosophy behind artistic uses of technology, so you can gain a greater understanding of how best to express your own creative vision using the software you write. The aim is to teach you “algorithmic thinking” – ways to conceptualise and model the world so you can express creative ideas using computer programs. A background in programming is not assumed or necessary. Each week we will start with a simple creative idea and guide you through turning that idea into a working computer program. We’ll be exploring programs that can generate images, animations and sound and you’ll learn how you can interact with them to change their behaviour. As you’ll discover, this opens a world of possibilities, because as you expand and modify your program new creative possibilities emerge. Starting with simple processes we will look at how to create increasingly complex and nuanced visual and sonic artworks using generative programming techniques. Assignments will give you the opportunity to explore your own creative ideas and share your achievements with fellow students. We will also look at how a number of leading professional artists and designers work creatively with computers, technology and robotics, examining their creative process and the ideas that inspire them. The course is very different from technical courses on programming. We will place creative programming in context through discussion about some of the most interesting questions raised by computer-generated art, such as: Can a computer be independently creative Who is the author of a work of computer art: the programmer or the program How is our understanding of art and creativity changed by technology Does the computer bring anything that is really new to art If you’ve ever wondered about these questions or wanted to learn how to program a computer for creative purposes, then this course is for you.', 'https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/creative-coding', 'http://view.vzaar.com/1569932/player', '2014-06-02', 6, 'https://ugc.futurelearn.com/uploads/images/37/29/hero_37297071-1b97-4aab-b6c9-452fe6ad7648.jpg', '', 'FutureLearn', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Monash University', '2014-04-16 01:05:50'),

We will also introduce the concept of cancer stem cells. Other key cancer pathways of angiogenesis (stimulating new blood vessel growth) and metastasis (tumour spread) will also be covered. Finally, we will discuss how our understanding of these pathways has informed the design of new treatments for cancer and some of the emerging challenges in the future.

Unfortunately for you, lending money is definitely a risky activity: there is no 100% guarantee that you will get all your money back. For example you may expect losses in your portfolio because of the default of your counterpart. Or, in a less extreme situation, the credit quality of your counterpart may deteriorate according to some rating system, so that your loan becomes more and more risky. These are typical situations in which credit risk manifests itself. According to the Basel Agreements, credit risk is one of the three fundamental risks, together with market risk and operational risk, a bank (or another regulated financial institution) has to face when operating on the markets. As the 2008 financial crisis has shown us, a correct understanding of credit risk and the ability to cope with it are fundamental in the world of today. The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to credit risk modeling and hedging. At the end of the course, the students will be able to understand and correctly use the basic tools of credit risk management, both from a theoretical and, most of all, a practical point of view. This will be a quite unconventional course. For every methodology, we will analyze its points of strengths, but we will also stress its points of weakness.

Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors including topics such as probabilistic state estimation, linear control, and path planning. You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings, how to navigate along a series of waypoints, and how to plan collision free trajectories. The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. The programming exercises will require you to write small code snippets in Python to make a quadrotor fly in simulation. This course is intended for graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering.

All stress isn’t bad, but chronic stress can take its toll on our minds, bodies, and behavior. Research has shown that people can learn and use specific resilience skills (such as optimistic thinking, relaxation strategies, choosing one’s attention) and positive routines (good sleep, scheduling in fun, and so on) in order to better manage stress, bounce back quicker after a setback, be more effective in their academic and vocational pursuits, develop stronger relationships with others, be physically and mentally healthy, and be satisfied with their lives overall. In short, resilience is ordinary magic and can be learned. It does not necessarily mean that you have to be born resilient or get lucky in life. The purpose of this course is to teach individuals the science behind becoming a resilient person. Stated simply, resilience is the ability to survive and thrive. Resiliency is not only about your ability to positively adapt in the face of adverse or challenging circumstances (that is, survive), but it is also about learning the positive skills, strategies and routines that enable you to live a happy, fulfilling, and meaningful life (in other words, thrive). This course gives you the permission to take care of yourself in order to effectively manage life stressors and do what matters most in life. This captures the notion of being from the inside out, which is a phrase that highlights the importance of promoting core resilience skills, strategies, and routines among early childhood educators. In turn, resilient people are more capable of creating and maintaining nurturing, supportive, and effective learning environments while also optimizing their own wellbeing and love for both the big and small things in life. By the end of this course, you will have learned about the knowledge and skills that you can apply in your life now and in the future to be a resilient person. Course goal: The goal for this course is to give you permission to take care of yourself and empower you to be a resilient person. A resilient person is someone who: purposely strives to be as mentally and psychically healthy as possible, possesses the confidence to effectively cope with and manage stressful situations, is compassionate towards self and others, demonstrates grit or perseverance even in the face of adversity, and focuses on the positive and fulfilling aspects of life. Course supporting objectives: When you complete this course, you will be able to: Describe why ‘functioning from the inside out’ is critical to becoming a resilient, effective person Explain the benefits of resilience and how the specific skills translate into optimizing social-emotional wellbeing and doing what matters most in life Directly practice a variety of resilience skills in different aspects of your life, including but not limited to: Mindfulness practices Strategies to manage intense emotions Activities that induce positive emotions Clarifying important personal values (that is, what matters most) and committing to behaving consistent with them Making health lifestyle choices that are cheap and readily available, yet promote well-being Describe why ‘practicing’ and integrating resilience skills into one’s life is critical to making them a habit and becoming a resilient person Develop a resilience plan that serves as a roadmap for your future', 'https://www.edx.org/course/uwashingtonx/uwashingtonx-ecfs311x-becoming-resilient-1652', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q7K0m9fziM', '2014-05-06', 9, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/resilience-262-136.jpg', 'Communication/Health & Safety/Humanities/Social Sciences', 'EDX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'University of Washington', '2014-04-16 01:06:07'),

If you have ever read an article that claimed, "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points," or, "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...," then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl''s school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.

But not many of those ideas are based on science. That’s where this course comes in. “The Science of Happiness” is the first MOOC to teach the ground-breaking science of positive psychology, which explores the roots of a happy and meaningful life. Students will engage with some of the most provocative and practical lessons from this science, discovering how cutting-edge research can be applied to their own lives. Created by UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Science Center, the course will zero in on a fundamental finding from positive psychology: that happiness is inextricably linked to having strong social connections and contributing to something bigger than yourself—the greater good. Students will learn about the cross-disciplinary research supporting this view, spanning the fields of psychology, neuroscience, evolutionary biology, and beyond. What’s more, “The Science of Happiness” will offer students practical strategies for nurturing their own happiness. Research suggests that up to 40 percent of happiness depends on our habits and activities. So each week, students will learn a new research-tested practice that fosters social and emotional well-being—and the course will help them track their progress along the way. The course’s co-instructors, Dacher Keltner and Emiliana Simon-Thomas, are not only leading authorities on positive psychology but also gifted teachers skilled at making science feel fun and personal.

If you choose to join this five-week course on Behavioral Medicine, you will learn about basic behavioral medicine concepts and explore how they can be applied to help people who need to change specific lifestyle behaviors to attain better health. Working with “virtual patient scenarios” will give you a chance to test behavioral medicine interventions. You will also learn self-help tools based on behavioral medicine, for whatever you need to change in your life. We’ll start the first week by looking at what makes us motivated to change our behavior. We often feel motivated for change when we experience imbalance in life. One example of a key concept that helps us understand how imbalance arises is the effort-reward model, which states that ill-health is more likely to arise when there is a gap between the effort you make and how you are rewarded. To help people who are experiencing imbalance identify what they need to change, we will learn about Motivational Interviewing (MI), a counseling style that stimulates behavior change. You will have an opportunity to test basic techniques in MI with a “virtual bartender” who has sleep problems that he is trying to solve by drinking alcohol. The following four weeks will focus on coping with stress (week 2), improving sleep (week 3), increasing physical activity (week 4), and everyday behaviors (week 5) like hand washing, condom use and minimizing risky alcohol use. To complete this course, you will need to set aside about 5-8 hours a week. You’ll use some of this time to watch course videos, answer questions designed to help you reinforce and retain what you have learned, and understand the homework required. The remaining time will be for course reading, mostly open access scientific articles, and solving homework tasks.

This course is based on a conviction that the more you know about an art, the more pleasure you will find in it.', 'The Art of Poetry, as the title implies, approaches poetry as an art. The assumption is that as with music, dance, film, painting, and photography, this art gives pleasure. And as with those arts, there is a lot to know. The music you choose to hear, the picture you put on your wall, are likely to become more engaging the more you decide to learn about them. This course is based on a conviction that the more you know about an art, the more pleasure you will find in it. And conversely, pleasure is essential to understanding an art. The Art of Poetry is not a creative writing course. You will not be asked to write poems. However, you will be looking very closely at elements of craft, sometimes as though through the eyes of a writer. The course is demanding, and based on a certain kind of intense, exigent reading, requiring prolonged, thorough— in fact, repeated— attention to specific poems. A central idea is that you, as a reader, say the poems aloud or at least imagine saying them aloud. The purpose is to think what it feels like to say the words of a particular poem: to imagine needing to say those exact words chosen by, for example, Emily Dickinson or Gerard Manley Hopkins, and to reflect on that feeling. The readings for this course will include historical poems, as well as contemporary work. The focus will be on elements of the art such as poetry’s historical relation to courtship; different kinds of repetition; poetry’s relation to music; the nature of greatness; techniques of sound in free verse—with only incidental attention to schools of poetry, categories and trends. The Favorite Poem Project videos at favoritepoem.org provide a model for the spirit of this course. The emphasis on voice is not performative: that is, as the videos demonstrate, the most important voice is that of each reader saying the poem (actual or imagined) — not necessarily the voice of the poet or a trained actor. Students are encouraged to think truly, carefully and passionately about what the poem says— that is, thinking about what you, as a reader, feel yourself saying as you give your voice to the poem. Robert Pinsky says, in the Preface to Singing School: “this anthology will succeed if it encourages the reader to emulate it by replacing it . . . create your own anthology.” In a comparable way, this course hopes to inspire a lifelong study of poetry.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/bux/bux-arpo222x-art-poetry-1565', 'n/a', '2014-09-01', 0, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/arpo22x-poetry-course-tile262x136.jpg', 'Art & Culture/Humanities/Literature', 'EDX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Boston University', '2014-04-16 01:06:21'),

Hence, as we delve into the dimensions that make Shakespeare’s plays so extraordinary--from the astonishing power of their language to their uncanny capacity to illuminate so much of human life--we will also explore them in performance from Shakespeare’s own theatre to the modern screen.

In this course, you will discover precisely what Borges meant.', 'Students will question for themselves the meaning of human freedom, responsibility and identity by reading and responding to Dante Alighieri''s Divine Comedy. The Comedy, which is richly steeped in the medieval culture of 14th century, still speaks vividly to modern readers struggling with the question, “who am I” Dante, as a Florentine, a poet, a lover, and religious believer struggled with the same question in each facet of his life before coming to a moment of vision that wholly transformed him as a person. As a 21st century reader, you will encounter the poem in a novel online environment that integrates knowledge from the disciplines of literature, history, psychology, philosophy, and theology with modern technology. You will be guided through the poem by means of the "MyDante" Project, an online environment developed by Professor Ambrosio in collaboration with the Georgetown University Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship (CNDLS), which will aid your own contemplative engagement with the poem. Alone and with the edX community, you will reflect on both Dante''s interpretation of freedom and how it functions in the formation of personal identity, and the problem of finding appropriate metaphors to discuss these issues in our modern life. You, the modern reader, will only understand the full implications of Dante''s poetry if you participate with it in a way that is personal and is genuinely contemplative. You will discover that contemplative reading goes beyond the literal meaning, and even beyond the traditional allegorical and interpreted meaning, to apply every possible meaning contained in the text to your own life and identity. Through the MyDante platform, you will learn to know yourself in your own historical, personal, and spiritual contexts as you journey toward a richer understanding of your freedom, identity and responsibility as a person. This module is the first of three modules that compose the full course. This module will take you through Vita Nuova and Inferno.

During this process of change, the capital of a military empire that once invaded East Asia experienced occupation by the U.S. armed forces, hosted the Olympic Games, and transformed into a consumer hub where young people could enjoy economic “wealth.” It is important to know that this process was recorded in countless photographs, documentary films, TV programs, and so on. We will retrieve many of these archived pictures and videos and analyze what happened in postwar Tokyo from different perspectives. In Part 1, you will look at the changes that occurred in postwar Tokyo over a quarter of a century from four different perspectives: 1) occupation by the U.S. armed forces; 2) consumption of images of the Emperor and the Imperial Household and redefinition as the imperial capital; 3) construction of the Olympic city Tokyo; and 4) changes in Shinjuku as a site of chaos and diversity. This examination of urban history will provide you with the insights necessary when considering changes in other large cities in Asia, such as Seoul, Beijing, and Bangkok, at the end of the twentieth century.

The main aim of the course, An Introduction to Global Health, is to describe and analyze variation in health between and within countries. This will provide an understanding of causes of the variation. The course will include measurements and determinants of health. Further, the course offers a public health perspective of the global burden of diseases. The course will specifically address: Maternal and Child Health; Sexual reproductive health and rights; Major infectious disease - malaria, TB, HIV, pneumonia; Non communicable disease; Mental health; Disasters; Injuries; Health systems and financing; and Health policy. Analysis will be done from a gender and equity perspective. The course combines different teaching methods: lectures, self-study, and exercises using gapminder tools (Gapminder.org) to analyze indicators. An added value is that the course is open to participants from different parts of the world, which creates an intercultural learning and teaching environment. By the end of this course, you should have a good idea of how these key global health challenges are approached by different stakeholders.

(84, ' Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials in Health Care', 'Pragmatic randomized controlled trials reliably work out which of several healthcare interventions works best under real-world conditions.', 'For the first hundreds of years of modern medicine, progress was a process of trial and error, and to be honest, it was often fatal error, such as bloodletting, which killed the first US president George Washington. Where diseases were clearly understood, and where treatments obviously worked on most patients, such as penicillin for pneumonia, there was no need to delve deeper into questions of effectiveness. But for most conditions, the treatment benefits were modest and there was a need for improved ways of telling whether a new intervention was better than the previous standard treatment. And so scientists introduced a testing procedure for new treatments - the randomized controlled trial. As the cost of developing new treatments grew, it became very important to detect the slightest improvement that could be attributed to the new drug in order to get it licensed and marketed. So the usual randomized trial was answering the following question: does this treatment work (for otherwise well people with just this single disease, with perfect adherence, treated by the best doctors, under idealised conditions) But most patients have multiple diseases, imperfect adherence, ordinary doctors and non-ideal circumstances. These patients want to know whether a new treatment is likely to reduce important harms for ordinary people like them, receiving usual care. This mismatch meant that most trials were overestimating the real world effectiveness of new interventions. In this MOOC, we are going to study this mismatch, and see what its effect is on modern medical care. One example of the studies we will discuss is the VIGOR trial. This influential drug trial resulted in the widespread global overuse of this drug, at a cost of wasted billions of dollars. Ironically, this drug, intended to reduce a problem in individuals, ended up causing more of the same problem in the population! After we understand the consequences of designing the wrong kinds of trials, we will also look at how best to design pragmatic randomized trials, which answer the important questions that ordinary patients and decision makers in the real world most often ask. We will also explore how these can be combined with economic evaluations and qualitative research – to answer important questions about how much these interventions cost, and how they are experienced by the recipients.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/kix/kix-kipractihx-pragmatic-randomized-1541', 'n/a', '2014-10-01', 6, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/kix_pragmatic_course_tile262x136.jpg', 'Biology & Life Sciences/Health & Safety/Medicine/Statistics & Data Analysis', 'EDX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Karolinska Institutet', '2014-04-16 01:06:27'),

Pre-tax subsidies, which arise when energy consumers pay less than the supply cost of energy, are high in many emerging and developing economies, and have risen in recent years. Although pre-tax subsidies are not a large enough problem in advanced economies to cause fiscal difficulties, these countries have tax subsidies, where the taxes imposed on energy are not high enough to account for all of the adverse effects of excessive energy consumption, including on the environment. The issue of energy subsidy reform is not new. Despite widespread recognition of their adverse consequences, energy subsidies have proven difficult to reform. This course builds on an extensive cross-country analysis, which is reported in the recently published IMF book on “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications,” to make recommendations on how to best implement reforms aimed at reducing state subsidies on energy. In the first part of the course, economists from the IMF will introduce the definition and measurement of subsidies, and then describe the economic, social, and environmental implications of subsidies. The second part of the course has two principal purposes: first, to review what works best in energy subsidy reform, in light of country experiences globally; and second, to illustrate successes and failures in particular country contexts by summarizing some case studies. Whether you are a civil servant working on economic issues for your country or simply interested in better understanding issues related to energy subsidies, this course will provide hands-on training on the design of successful reforms of energy subsidies.

Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10 What is the law of averages How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population What should you expect to happen "just by chance" These are some of the questions we will address in the course. We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions. Be warned: by the end of Stat2.2x you will not want to gamble. Ever. (Unless you''re really good at counting cards, in which case you could try blackjack, but perhaps after taking all these edX courses you''ll find other ways of earning money.) As Stat2.2x is part of a series, the basic prerequisites are the same as those for Stat2.1x: high school arithmetic and good comprehension of English. In addition, you are expected to know the material of Stat2.1x, with particular emphasis on histograms, averages, SDs, and the normal curve. The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-stat2-2x-introduction-1534', 'n/a', '2014-04-14', 5, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/stat22_262x136_verified.png', 'Statistics & Data Analysis', 'EDX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'UC Berkeley', '2014-04-16 01:06:34'),

The course is the online equivalent of Statistics 2, a 15-week introductory course taken in Berkeley by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2x is divided into three 5-week components. Stat2.1x is the first of the three. The focus of Stat2.1x is on descriptive statistics. The goal of descriptive statistics is to summarize and present numerical information in a manner that is illuminating and useful. The course will cover graphical as well as numerical summaries of data, starting with a single variable and progressing to the relation between two variables. Methods will be illustrated with data from a variety of areas in the sciences and humanities. There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods.

The course focuses on the fundamental energy balance in the climate system, between incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation, and how this balance is affected by greenhouse gases. We will also discuss physical processes that shape the climate, such as atmospheric and oceanic convection and large-scale circulation, solar variability, orbital mechanics, and aerosols, as well as the evidence for past and present climate change. We will discuss climate models of varying degrees of complexity, and you will be able to run a model of a single column of the Earth''s atmosphere, which includes many of the important elements of simulating climate change. Together, this range of topics forms the scientific basis for our understanding of anthropogenic (human-influenced) climate change. We will not cover issues regarding policy responses to climate change. Rather, Global Warming Science is designed to be a strictly scientific introduction to this important topic. 12.340x is geared toward students with some mathematical and scientific background, but does not require any prior knowledge of climate or atmospheric science. See the prerequisites section for more details. Course Structure The course will be divided into weekly sections which will be released sequentially. Each section will include a set of lecture videos and practice exercises that students will be expected to work through.

Together, they are designed to help people with no prior exposure to computer science or programming learn to think computationally and write programs to tackle useful problems. Some of the people taking the two courses will use them as a stepping stone to more advanced computer science courses, but for many it will be their first and last computer science courses. Since these courses may be the only formal computer science courses many of the students take, we have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics so they will have an idea of what is possible when they need to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal later in their career. That said, they are not "computation appreciation" courses. They are challenging and rigorous courses in which the students spend a lot of time and effort learning to bend the computer to their will.

How can we get people to save more money, eat healthy foods and engage in healthy behaviours, and more generally make better choices There has been a lot written about the fact that human beings do not process information and make decisions in an optimal fashion. This course builds on much of the fascinating work in the area of behavioural economics and allows the student to develop a hands-on approach by learning its methods and more importantly, how it can be harnessed by suitably designing contexts to “nudge” choice. In three modules, students will be able to a) explain and interpret the principles underlying decision-making and compare the nudging approach to other methods of behaviour change, b) learn how to critique, design and interpret experiments; and c) design nudges and decision-tools to help people make better decisions.  Students will also witness and participate in weekly topical debates on topics like “does irrationality impact welfare” or “Is nudging manipulative” If you’ve been fascinated with the buzz surrounding behavioural economics but are not sure how to actually use it, this course is for you.

COURSE OVERVIEW Iran’s nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria’s civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information — these are among the challenges American national security students in 211x will wrestle with this year.  This introduction is based on one of the most popular, and dynamic, courses taught at Harvard''s Kennedy School of Government. In each case, students are cast as a trusted NSC staffer to President Obama, or to another principal in the policy-making process.  Each case requires not only reexamining current U.S. strategy, but also identifying alternative strategies for protecting and advancing national interests. In each of these cases, which include a special two-week segment on the disclosures surrounding NSA surveillance and the trove of WikiLeaks documents of previously-secret American policymaking, participants have to operate in the rough-and-tumble of a government whose deliberations are discombobulated by leaks, reports about internal differences among policymakers, and press analyses. Weekly assignments require strategic thinking: analyzing dynamics of challenges and developing strategies for addressing them.  Students learn to summarize their analyses in a succinct “Strategic Options Memo” that combines careful analysis and strategic imagination, on the one hand, with the necessity to communicate to major constituencies in order to sustain public support, on the other. They also examine how policymaking is affected by constant, public analysis of government deliberations.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-hks211-1x-central-challenges-1087', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQKsju_u9_0', '2013-10-01', 8, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/hks211x_course_tile262x136.jpg', 'History/Law/Philosophy & Ethics/Social Sciences', 'EDX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Harvard', '2014-04-16 01:07:34'),

That past can be directly observed through the study of the human fossil record, the materials preserved for archaeological study, and the DNA of living and extinct human populations. This course will provide an overview of human evolutionary history from the present--contemporary human variation in a comparative context--through our last common ancestor with the living great apes, some 5-7 million years in the past. Emphasis will be placed on major evolutionary changes in the development of humans and the methodological approaches used by paleoanthropologists and related investigators to develop that knowledge. The course will begin by asking basic questions about how evolution operates to shape biological variation and what patterns of variation look like in living humans and apes. We will then look at how the human lineage first began to differentiate from apes, the rise and fall of the Australopithecines, the origin and dispersal of the genus Homo, and eventually the radical evolutionary changes associated with the development of agricultural practices in the past 15,000 years. Throughout the course students will be exposed to the primary data, places and theories that shape our understanding of human evolution.

This course will examine architecture through time, beginning with First Societies and extending to the 15th century. Though the course is chronological, it is not intended as a linear narrative, but rather aims to provide a more global view, by focusing on different architectural "moments." The lectures will give students the appropriate grounding for understanding a range of buildings and contexts. The material in the lectures will be supplemented by readings from the textbook A Global History of Architecture. Each lecture analyzes a particular architectural transformation arising from a dynamic cultural situation. How did the introduction of iron in the ninth century BCE impact regional politics and the development of architecture How did new religious formations, such as Buddhism and Hinduism, produce new architectural understandings What were the architectural consequences of the changing political landscape in northern Italy in the 14th century How did rock-cut architecture move across space and time from West Asia to India to Africa How did the emergence of corn impact the rise of religious and temple construction in Mexico These are typical questions that the lectures will address.

Unit processes involved in the two treatment chains will be described as well as the physical, chemical and biological processes involved. There will be an emphasis on water quality and the functionality of each unit process within the treatment chain.  After the course one should be able to recognise the process units, describe their function and make simple design calculations on water treatment  plants (drinking and waste water).  Overall the course will teach the role of treatment technologies in providing adequate water supply and effective sanitation which are essential for human society and the safeguarding of public and environmental health. There is a global trend towards urbanisation with over 50% of humanity currently residing in urban areas. Water is invariably linked to urban functionality, as industrial, domestic and agricultural use. Essential services such as drinking water supply, sanitation and wastewater treatment to protect surface water and groundwater resources need to be present in such environment. The provision of these essential urban water services present real challenges in many parts of the world today. Accessible fresh water resources suitable for drinking water and other ecosystem services is approximated to be 200,000 km3, approximately 0.3% of the total freshwater resources and less than 0.01% of the total water on earth. These accessible freshwater resources are not equally distributed and many countries today are experiencing water scarcity which in turn affects community health and in many places water scarcity is the inhibiting factor for economic growth. This highlights the importance of conserving and protecting the accessible freshwater resources, through the implementation of adequate treatment technologies combined with a robust infrastructure. Through utilising relevant treatment technologies to upgrade water to a quality suitable for subsequent use or discharge with more and more stringent effluent demands, the urban water chain has the possibility to transform to an urban water cycle and improve interactions within the greater hydrological cycle.

Philosophers, scientists, artists, and poets overthrew our understanding of the physical world, of human behavior, of thought and its limits, and of art, creativity, and beauty. Scientific progress improved the way we lived across the world. Yet the last century also brought increased levels of war, tyranny, and genocide. Man pushed boundaries of good and evil, right and wrong, justice and injustice – and people lost faith in values. Now, thinkers and leaders are reconstructing theories of value and creating institutions to embody them. Join this thought-provoking, broad-sweeping course as it draws intriguing connections between philosophy, art, literature, and history, illuminating our world and our place in it.

Your grade will be as follows: A (more than 85%), B (70-85%), C (60-70%). At least 60% must be obtained to qualify for a certificate. The book is available on line without charge, but you can also buy a printed copy of the book (publisher Wiley). Since the book is a record of things you will soon forget, Professor Lewin recommends you buy the book if you can afford it. ABOUT THE LECTURES Lewin''s lectures at MIT are legendary. Many have been shown for over six years (starting in 1995) on UWTV in Seattle, reaching an audience of about four million people. For fifteen years (starting in 1983) he was on MIT Cable TV helping freshmen with their weekly homework assignments. His programs were aired 24 hours per day and were frequently watched by upper-class students. Additionally, his 35 lectures on Newtonian Mechanics, 36 lectures on Electricity and Magnetism and 23 lectures on Vibrations and Waves can also be viewed at MIT''S OpenCourseWare, iTunes U, YouTube and Academic Earth. About 5000 people daily from all over the world watch these lectures - that''s about two million people per year! Many teachers show them regularly in their classrooms. Bill Gates even wrote Professor Lewin that he has watched all his lectures more than once and he has learned a lot from them. The many responses that Professor Lewin receives daily are quite wonderful and often very moving.

Make sure to check for reruns of this course. What is it to be human, and how can ancient concepts of the heroic and anti-heroic inform our understanding of the human condition That question is at the core of The Ancient Greek Hero, which introduces (or reintroduces) students to the great texts of classical Greek culture by focusing on concepts of the Hero in an engaging, highly comparative way. The classical Greeks'' concepts of Heroes and the "heroic" were very different from the way we understand the term today. In this course, students analyze Greek heroes and anti-heroes in their own historical contexts, in order to gain an understanding of these concepts as they were originally understood while also learning how they can inform our understanding of the human condition in general. In Greek tradition, a hero was a human, male or female, of the remote past, who was endowed with superhuman abilities by virtue of being descended from an immortal god. Rather than being paragons of virtue, as heroes are viewed in many modern cultures, ancient Greek heroes had all of the qualities and faults of their fellow humans, but on a much larger scale. Further, despite their mortality, heroes, like the gods, were objects of cult worship – a dimension which is also explored in depth in the course. The original sources studied in this course include the Homeric Iliad and Odyssey; tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; songs of Sappho and Pindar; dialogues of Plato; historical texts of Herodotus; and more, including the intriguing but rarely studied dialogue "On Heroes" by Philostratus. All works are presented in English translation, with attention to the subtleties of the original Greek. These original sources are frequently supplemented both by ancient art and by modern comparanda, including opera and cinema (from Jacques Offenbach''s opera Tales of Hoffman to Ridley Scott''s science fiction classic Blade Runner). The true hero of the course is the logos ("word") of reasoned expression, as activated by Socratic dialogue. The logos of dialogue requires both careful thought and close (or "slow") reading, which is a core skill taught in this class. The course begins by considering the heroes of Homer''s epics and ends with Plato''s memories of the final days of Socrates -- memories which can only be fully understood by a reader who has gained a thorough comprehension of the ancient Greek hero in all his or her various manifestations. Using modern technology and engaging texts, The Ancient Greek Hero provides students who have no previous background in classical Greek civilization with a fully engaging and immediately accessible introduction to the most beautiful moments in this ancient literature, its myths, and its ritual practices.

Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley''s Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member What if you can only reach a subset of the population   Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.   The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, "The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points," or, "Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...," then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl''s school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.   The fundamental approach of the series was provided in the description of Stat2.1x and appears here again: There will be no mindless memorization of formulas and methods. Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on understanding the reasoning behind the calculations, the assumptions under which they are valid, and the correct interpretation of results.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/uc-berkeleyx/uc-berkeleyx-stat2-3x-introduction-825', 'n/a', '2013-07-19', 5, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/stat23_262x136.jpg', 'Statistics & Data Analysis', 'EDX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'UC Berkeley', '2014-04-16 01:07:56'),

It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to any students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and those who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics. Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, and angular momentum. Optional units include oscillations, planetary orbits, and a review of multi-concept problems. Why Take Our Course Our approach to mechanics is a unique one. Through worked examples and online texts we introduce a strategic overview of core concepts in mechanics. This overview couples with a new approach to problem-solving that will help you break down and solve multi-concept problems. By choosing a system of objects, defining their interactions, and deciding on a model to use to describe them, you will come to solve physics problems more easily and more systematically. The road to "easy" goes through "hard." This course is more challenging than a standard high school or introductory college physics offering. We will help you become a more expert problem solver, and that process involves solving a variety of problems, in many different ways, with our new approach. The reward is stronger problem-solving ability that carries over to other areas in physics. Take this course to better organize your mechanics knowledge, to prepare for AP or advanced standing exams, to teach more effectively, or if you enjoy attacking challenging problems! For Teachers If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up. Our approach has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness when it comes to preparing students for later courses.

Quantitative Methods in Clinical and Public Health Research is the online adaptation of material from the Harvard School of Public Health''s classes in epidemiology and biostatistics. Principled investigations to monitor and thus improve the health of individuals are firmly based on a sound understanding of modern quantitative methods. This involves the ability to discover patterns and extract knowledge from health data on a sample of individuals and then to infer, with measured uncertainty, the unobserved population characteristics. This course will address this need by covering the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for public health and clinical research. These include outcomes measurement, measures of associations between outcomes and their determinants, study design options, bias and confounding, probability and diagnostic tests, confidence intervals and hypothesis testing, power and sample size determinations, life tables and survival methods, regression methods (both, linear and logistic), and sample survey techniques. Students will analyze sample data sets to acquire knowledge of appropriate computer software. By the end of the course the successful student should have attained a sound understanding of these methods and a solid foundation for further study.', 'https://www.edx.org/course/harvardx/harvardx-ph207x-health-numbers-354', 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9CqWffkVNw', '2012-10-15', 13, 'https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/course/image/tile/ph207x-listing-banner.jpg', 'Health & Safety/Math/Medicine/Statistics & Data Analysis', 'EDX', 0, 'English', 'yes', 'Harvard', '2014-04-16 01:08:00');
